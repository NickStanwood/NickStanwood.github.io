## pathfinder World Builder

The Pathfinder World Builder allows a Dungeon Master to create an entire world from start to finish for a pathfinder campaign. The application is designed to be as inclusive in the design process as the user needs. If they want to store everything, right down to the name of the butcher in a town 200 miles away from the main plot of the story, they are more than welcome to. If they prefer to keep only the main plot points stored, that works just as well.

##### Dungeon Creator
You had a busy week and now you don't have a session prepared? No problem, use the random dungeon creator for your adventurers to go dungeon crawling for the day. Complete with random encounters in *mostly* every room, and lots of loot. Only requires the party level, the number of adventurers, and the estimated time to clear to create the dungeon. A theme can also be chosen for a more immersive experience. Complete with a DM map for you and an adventurers map for them.

##### Town Creator
The party has made some unexpected decisions, and you now find yourself in need of a town of 200 people? No problem, use the random Town Creator to design a town, complete with a map layout and merhcants. You can even add random story hooks that can take your adventurers to a dungeon.

###### Character Creator
Need an NPC on short notice for your adventurers to fight or possibly even team up with? No Problem, input as much information as you'd like into the Character Creator and it will use the optimization level you specify to randomize the rest of the information. the lower the optimization, the more *interesting* the results. Going with max optimization may net you an Orc barbarian that has the potential to break every bone in your adventurers body's. Going with minimum optimization means you might end up with a goblin wizard that only has one arm, and spells that all require a somatic component.
